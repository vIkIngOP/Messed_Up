# Messed_Up
This thing can literally mess up your computer.There are a total of two files in this repository '.py' and '.exe'. '.py' file is a code file which you can edit and create a new programme using my exesting code and '.exe' file is an executable file which has been converted so that it can run on any PC which don't have python installed.
